# ECrop-Market
This project is developed using PHP and MySQL.

E- Crop Market is a web application that facilitates venders to buy crops just like they buy at the mandi in person and allows them to keep track of all their purchases.

Also this application allows farmers to sell their crops online without travelling anywhere and stand in heat and they can easily get the appropriate price of their crops at their fingertips.

This application can automatically generate the receipts for both sides after the completion of the bidding to track the complete record.

The expected outcome of the website is that farmers and venders both can easily perform their tasks of selling and bidding of crops.
